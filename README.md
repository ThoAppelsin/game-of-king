## Details of the Game

Game of the King, originally *Papaz Oyunu* in Turkish, is (as far as we remember) a made up game
by myself and my cousin at the ages when we both were preschoolers.
It has very simple set of rules, making it interesting to people who want to get relaxed and do not want to think much.

### Setup

1) Played with 2 players, of all ages.
2) A standard deck of 52 cards are shuffled and split into two.
3) Piles of 26 cards are kept upside-down.
4) Player who did not deal the cards is the one who starts the game.

### Progression

It is a turn based game. On each turn, the player with the turn;

- (if he/she has cards left on his/her pile) deals the top-most card on his/her pile onto the pile on the ground, face-up,
- (otherwise) **collects** the pile of cards on the ground.

If the card dealt by the player has the same number or sign as the top-most card of the pile on the ground,
the player with the turn again **collects** the pile of cards on the ground.

Finally, if the dealt card is a King;

- (if there were no cards on the ground) nothing happens,
- (otherwise) the player again **collects** the pile of card on the ground.

In any case, now it is the turn of the other player.

#### Collecting the deck on the ground

All the cards facing up on the ground are simply gathered and turned upside-down as a whole.
The gathered new pile is placed underneath the pile of the player, making the player's pile larger.

Except for the very beginning of the game, this is the only moment when the ground is empty,
making it possible for a King to be left on the ground, and possibly changing owner.

### Ending

The game ends when all the cards are collected by a player, who also becomes the winner.

## The Catch

As you may have noticed, the result of the game has absolutely nothing to do with the players' skill.
In fact, if you look carefully, the result of the game is determined at the very beginning, when the cards are split into two.

Regardless, it is a fun game, and dare I say, even mildly addictive.
Don't believe me? Just try it with a friend and a real deck of cards.
As innocent as it looks, you will start feeling the strange excitement in under 1-2 minutes as the pile on the ground grows.

It gets even more exciting to see (and even expect to see) a King falling down on the ground.

It usually takes very long, sometimes even an hour, to finish a game.
However, once you start a game and get excited for a couple of times under 5-10 minutes,
it won't be easy to cut it out and leave.
***You will feel drawn into simulating the game with an ending destined from the very beginning.***

## The Program

I have written this client-side web application in the summer of 2016 by the request of a friend.
He wanted a simulator for the game which he could watch and speed up on demand.

The application, written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, 

He also wanted to be able to input the list of cards himself. This would probably help him in giving up on a game
and let the computer simulate the rest. That functionality, is not yet available in this application.
It would be a tedious work to input 52 cards one by one, any way.
